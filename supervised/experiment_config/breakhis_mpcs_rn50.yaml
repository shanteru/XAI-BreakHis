#Every yaml file describes experiments of finetuning in supervised setting. It typically covers all 5 folds and all 4 magnfications in evaluation. 
#Based on configurations, it initilizes pretrained weights from given setting of pretrained model for batch-sisze and epochs on which pretrained was completed.

#Data
"data_path": "/home/datasets/BreaKHis_v1/histology_slides/breast"
"train_data_portion": "train_20" # possibles values based on data volume "train_20", "train_40", "train_60", "train_80", "train" - means full training data
"val_data_portion": "val"
"test_data_portion": "test" #evaluation on validation and test set done after traning completion by its own and results are logged in csv file
"magnification_list": ["40X", "100X", "200X", "400X"] #currently actual magnification input logic is not working and it is defined in paython file main fuction manually. IT works with manual input value for all folds.
